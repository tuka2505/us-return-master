        <article class="content">
            <p>Walmart and Target are the two giants of US retail, but when it comes to returning a product, their rules are surprisingly different. If you shop at both, knowing these differences can save you a lot of headache.</p>

            <h2>1. The Standard Window: A Tie?</h2>
            <p>Both Walmart and Target offer a very generous <strong>90-day return window</strong> for most items. This is significantly longer than the 30-day industry standard. However, the "fine print" is where they differ.</p>

            <h2>2. Target’s Secret Weapon: Own-Brand Guarantee</h2>
            <p>Target has a massive advantage if you buy their store brands (like Cat & Jack, Good & Gather, or Threshold). Any Target-owned brand item can be returned within <strong>one full year (365 days)</strong> if you aren't satisfied, even if it's used!</p>

            <h2>3. Electronics and Tech Exceptions</h2>
            <p>This is where shoppers often get confused. 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Walmart:</strong> Most electronics must be returned within 15 days. Post-paid cell phones have a strict 14-day limit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Target:</strong> Electronics generally have a 30-day window. However, Apple products are limited to 15 days.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>4. Return Without a Receipt</h2>
            <p>Lost your receipt?
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Walmart:</strong> If you don't have a receipt, Walmart can often look up the transaction using the card you used. If they can't find it, they may offer a store credit for items under $25 (ID required).</li>
                    <li><strong>Target:</strong> Target is excellent at looking up receipts via your Target app or the card used. They also offer a "No-Receipt Return" limit of up to $100 per year for a merchandise return card.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <div class="pro-tip" style="background: #e7f3ff; padding: 15px; border-left: 5px solid #007bff; margin: 20px 0;">
                <strong>The Verdict:</strong> If you buy electronics, **Target** is slightly better with its 30-day window. If you buy clothing or household goods, **Target’s 1-year brand guarantee** makes it the clear winner for long-term satisfaction.
