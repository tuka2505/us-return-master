            <p class="meta">Updated: February 2026 | Special Holiday Edition</p>

            <p>The holiday season is the busiest time for shopping, and US retailers know that many gifts are bought weeks in advance. To accommodate this, most major stores offer <strong>Extended Holiday Return Windows</strong>.</p>

            <h2>1. Amazon’s Long Holiday Window</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, most items purchased on Amazon between <strong>November 1 and December 31</strong> can be returned until <strong>January 31</strong> of the following year.</p>

            <h2>2. Walmart and Target Extensions</h2>
            <p>Walmart and Target typically offer similar extensions. For items with short return windows (like 15-day electronics), the "clock" doesn't start ticking until <strong>December 26</strong>.</p>

            <h2>3. Apple Store Specifics</h2>
            <p>Apple usually has a very tight 14-day policy, but during the holidays, they soften it. Items received between early November and December 25 are typically returnable through <strong>January 8</strong>.</p>

            <h2>4. What Stays the Same?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Final Sale items remain non-returnable.</li>
                <li>Restocking fees still apply to activatable devices.</li>
                <li>Proof of purchase (or a gift receipt) is still highly recommended.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="pro-tip" style="background: #d4edda; padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #28a745; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px;">
                <strong>Gift Tip:</strong> Always ask for a **Gift Receipt**. It allows the recipient to return the item for store credit without knowing how much you spent!
