            <p>Receiving a gift that isn't quite right is awkward. Trying to return it without a receipt can be even worse. While many retailers have tightened their policies to prevent fraud, it is still possible to return gifts without proof of purchase.</p>

            <h2>1. Expect Store Credit, Not Cash</h2>
            <p>Almost universally, if you do not have a receipt, the store will only offer you **Merchandise Credit (Store Gift Card)**. They will not give you cash back to your original payment method.</p>

            <h2>2. Bring Your Government-Issued ID</h2>
            <p>Stores like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy track "no-receipt returns" to prevent abuse. They will require a valid driver's license or state ID. They scan it to ensure you haven't exceeded their annual limit for receipt-less returns.</p>

            <h2>3. The "Lowest Selling Price" Rule</h2>
            <p>Without a receipt, you will receive the item's current lowest selling price within the last 30-90 days. If the item was on sale for 50% off last week, that is the amount you will get, even if the giver paid full price.</p>

            <h2>4. Retailers Famous for Easy No-Receipt Returns</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Walmart:</strong> Allows up to 3 no-receipt returns within a 45-day period (ID required).</li>
                <li><strong>Target:</strong> Allows up to $100 worth of no-receipt returns per year (ID required).</li>
                <li><strong>Home Depot:</strong> Usually very lenient if you have an ID, offering store credit easily.</li>
            </ul>

                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The best strategy is to ask the giver for a **Gift Receipt**. It has no prices on it but acts as full proof of purchase for an easy return or exchange!
