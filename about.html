            <h1>About US Return Master</h1>
            <p class="meta">Established: February 2026 | Dedicated to Smart Consumerism</p>

            <p>Welcome to <strong>US Return Master</strong>, your premier destination for navigating the complex world of retail returns in the United States. Founded in 2026, our mission is simple: to empower consumers with the information and tools they need to protect their hard-earned money.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Every year, American consumers lose millions of dollars simply because they missed a return deadline or misunderstood a store's "fine print." We believe that transparency in retail policies is a consumer right. Our platform provides a precise <strong>Return Deadline Tracker</strong> and expert-curated guides to ensure you never miss a refund again.</p>

            <h2>Why Trust Us?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Up-to-Date Data:</strong> We constantly monitor over 20+ major US retailers to provide 2026-current policy updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Expert Insights:</strong> Our guides go beyond the basics, offering strategic advice on "box-free" returns, restocking fees, and holiday extensions.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer-First Approach:</strong> We are an independent entity, meaning our advice is unbiased and focused solely on the shopper's benefit.</li>
            </ul>
