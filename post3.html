            <h1>5 Secret Costco Return Perks Every Member Should Know</h1>
            <p class="meta">Updated: February 2026 | Insider Tips by US Return Master</p>

            <p>Costco is famous for its "Risk-Free 100% Satisfaction Guarantee." While most people know they have a great policy, there are several "secret" perks that even long-time members often miss.</p>

            <h2>1. The "Lifetime" Return Window</h2>
            <p>Unlike almost any other retailer, Costco does not have a formal time limit on most returns. Whether you bought a vacuum cleaner two years ago or a set of plates last month, if it breaks or you aren't satisfied, you can usually return it for a full refund.</p>

            <h2>2. No Receipt? No Problem</h2>
            <p>Because every purchase is tied to your membership card, Costco has a digital record of everything you've ever bought. You don't need to save paper receipts; just show your membership card at the returns desk.</p>

            <h2>3. Returning Opened Food</h2>
            <p>Did you try a new snack and hated the taste? Costco allows you to return opened food items for a full refund. The only unofficial rule is that at least 50% of the product should still be in the package.</p>

            <h2>4. Electronics: The 90-Day Exception</h2>
            <p>While most items are "lifetime," electronics have a strict <strong>90-day limit</strong>. This includes TVs, computers, major appliances, and cameras. However, Costco offsets this by providing free technical support and often extending the manufacturer's warranty.</p>

            <h2>5. Diamonds and Jewelry</h2>
            <p>Costco sells high-end jewelry, but these have special rules. Diamonds over 1.00 carat require all original paperwork (GIA certificates) and will undergo a 48-hour verification process by a gemologist before a refund is issued.</p>

                <strong>Insider Tip:</strong> If you lose your physical membership card, you can use the Costco app to show your digital membership at the return counter.
