            <p>Have you ever returned a brand-new drone or a DSLR camera only to find out you didn't get a full refund? You likely ran into a <strong>Restocking Fee</strong>. At Best Buy, these fees can be as high as $45 or 15% of the purchase price.</p>

            <h2>1. Which Items Have Restocking Fees?</h2>
            <p>At Best Buy, restocking fees typically apply to "activatable" or high-end tech products, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cell phones (Standard fee is $45)</li>
                    <li>Drones and DSLR Cameras</li>
                    <li>Projectors and Rideables (Electric bikes/scooters)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>2. Why Do They Charge This?</h2>
            <p>Retailers charge these fees because once a high-end tech item is opened, it cannot be sold as "new" again. They must test, repackage, and sell it as "Open-Box" at a discount. The fee helps cover that loss.</p>

            <h2>3. How to Avoid the Fee</h2>
            <p>The best way to avoid a restocking fee is to <strong>not open the box</strong>. If the factory seal is intact, Best Buy will not charge a fee. Additionally, if the product is defective, the fee is usually waived.</p>

            <h2>4. Membership Perks</h2>
            <p>If you are a <strong>My Best Buy Total</strong> or <strong>Plus</strong> member, you may have different terms. Always check your membership dashboard before making a big tech purchase.</p>

                <strong>Warning:</strong> For cell phones, you only have **14 days** to return them, even if you are a premium member. The $45 restocking fee applies even if the phone is returned within that window.
